# Mr. Techy's discord.js tutorials

## 1. Go to my YouTube channel
I have tutorials with this command and event handler, it will be a lot easier to follow those tutorials than to figure it out by yourself.

## 2. Save this project as a .zip file
You can save this project as a .zip and then open it in your file manager. After that, import it into your code editor.

## 3. Install the packages
Now you have to install the required packages for it to work. Go to your terminal and type in `npm install discord.js fs`. This will install the _discord.js_ and _fs_ packages.

## 4. Insert the token into `config.json`
Now we insert your token into the `config.json` file. If you don't know where to get your token, watch the video on my channel.

## 5. Start your bot!
Now, open your terminal again, and type in `npm init -y`. Wait for it to load, then type `node index.js`. The bot should start! Keep in mind that whenever your change something in your code, you will need to restart your bot by typing in `node index.js`.

# All of these steps are also on my YouTube channel if you want video tutorials.
